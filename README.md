##End to End machine learning project (student performane prediction)
Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts students' academic performance based on various factors such as demographics, study habits, and past achievements.

Features
Gender: Male or Female.
Parental Education: Highest education level of parents.
Study Hours: Weekly hours dedicated to study.
Attendance: Class attendance percentage.
Previous Grades: Past academic performance.
Target: Final exam grade or performance category (e.g., Pass/Fail).
Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and encode categorical features.
Normalize numerical features.
Feature Engineering:

Identify key predictors using correlation analysis.
Modeling:

Train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Evaluate models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
Prediction:

Use the best-performing model to predict student performance.



Results
The model accurately predicts student performance, helping educators identify students needing support and improving learning outcomes.
